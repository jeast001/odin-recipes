    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This air fryer Cornish hen recipe is a basic, no-fail recipe. I use Tyson hens because they are two pounds each and perfect for two people once the bones are discarded.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) Cornish hen, giblets removed</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pat Cornish hen dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper on all sides.</li>
        <li>Place hen into the air fryer basket and cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes. Spray the top with nonstick spray and cook until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer hen to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes. Carve and serve.</li>
    </ol>
